# Documentation Quality Rules

Ten categories of rules for high-quality documentation.

1. **Fast** — Pages load quickly (prefer static). Optimize images, fonts, scripts. Search must be fast.
2. **Readable** — Be concise (every token counts). Avoid jargon and idioms. Optimize for skimming (bold, lists, headings, images). Keep first-time experience simple, reveal complexity gradually. Many code examples users can copy/paste or run.
3. **Helpful** — Document workarounds even for product gaps. Make it easy to leave feedback. Automate broken link checks. Create structured learning material. For breaking changes, include codemods and migration guides.
4. **AI-native** — Prefer cURL over "click" instructions. Prefer prompts over tutorials where appropriate.
5. **Agent-ready** — Make content easy to copy/paste as Markdown. Support viewing pages as Markdown.
6. **Polished** — Generous hit areas for buttons. Sidebars retain scroll position. Good active/hover states. Every heading and section linkable with stable anchors. Related guides, APIs, and examples cross-link.
7. **Localized** — Use server-side routing for language. Localize static strings and content.
8. **Responsive** — Great mobile menus. Tooltips on desktop, popovers on mobile.
9. **Accessible** — Skip nav to main content. All images have alt tags. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
10. **Universal** — Ship docs-as-code with KDoc. Ship rules files with the product.
