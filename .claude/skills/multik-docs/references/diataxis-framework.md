# Diátaxis Framework

The Diátaxis framework by Daniele Procida distinguishes four fundamental types of documentation, each geared towards a specific audience and purpose.

## Tutorials

The main goal of a tutorial is to help beginners getting started. The focus is on learning and acquiring the competencies required to use the software. The tutorial should contain step-by-step instructions. Each step should be easily attainable and provide concrete, meaningful results. The structure should be clear and linear. After completing the tutorial, the user should be ready to work with the other parts of the documentation.

**Audience**: Beginners
**Purpose**: Learning

## Guides

How-to guides contain precise directions how to achieve a specific goal. In contrast to learning-oriented tutorials, a guide is task-oriented documentation. The user has a concrete question in mind, such as "How do I create a 2D array?". A guide already assumes a certain degree of familiarity with the subject area. Unnecessary details can be omitted — the goal is not to give the full picture, but to help the user while working with the software.

**Audience**: Intermediate
**Purpose**: Problem-solving

## Reference

Technical reference documentation that describes in detail how the machinery works. For a library, this is most likely the API reference. The main goal is information retrieval — it should be very concise and to the point. Should also include common pitfalls to be aware of.

**Audience**: Experienced
**Purpose**: Information retrieval

## Explanation

More detailed background material that further clarifies understanding. An in-depth overview of the library design, architecture decisions, or internals. Also known as background, discussion, or conceptual guides.

**Audience**: Experts, developers
**Purpose**: Understanding
